# 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google

## Unit 1 : Intro to LLMs and prompt engineering

Exploring the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. and the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction and evaluating LLMs.

The first codelab will walk you through getting started with the Gemini 2.0 API and cover several prompt techniques including how different parameters impact the prompts. In the second codelab, you will also learn how to evaluate the response of LLMs using autoraters and structured output.

## Unit 3: Generative AI Agents and Agents companion

Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process. Also learn more about advanced agentic architectures and approaches such as multi-agent systems, agent evaluation and more.

The codelabs cover how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. Learn about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot (including an example using Gemini 2.0’s [Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live)), and learn how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a café.

# Unit 4 - “Domain-Specific LLMs”:

Delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and MedLM/Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

In the codelabs, learn how to add real-world data to a model using Google Search and then visualize it with plotting tools via the Live API. You will also learn how to fine-tune a custom Gemini model using your own labeled data to solve custom tasks.
