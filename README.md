# 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google

## Unit 1 : Intro to LLMs and prompt engineering

Exploring the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. and the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction and evaluating LLMs.

The first codelab will walk you through getting started with the Gemini 2.0 API and cover several prompt techniques including how different parameters impact the prompts. In the second codelab, you will also learn how to evaluate the response of LLMs using autoraters and structured output.
